# Project Background

WiseTree is created for WiseTech to use as an alternative to the pre-existing `Strategies and Tactics Tree` solution. The project is aimed at creating a robust and scalable web app that would not only replace the later, but lay foundation work for future internal tools for WiseTech as well.

# Development

## Setting Up

-   Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (This is a runtime for developing and building this project). This will also install npm by default. Confirm by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` in your CLI, the installed version will be printed
-   Install all node-module dependencies by using the `npm install` command project directory

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
